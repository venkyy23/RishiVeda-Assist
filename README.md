# \# 🌿 RishiVeda Assist

# 

# \*\*RishiVeda Assist\*\* is a UX research and design project focused on improving communication and workflow efficiency in Ayurvedic Panchakarma management.

# 

# This initiative was inspired by real-world challenges faced by Ayurvedic doctors and therapists in managing treatment scheduling, documentation, and communication.  

# The goal is to create digital solutions that simplify these processes while preserving the essence of Ayurvedic practice.
