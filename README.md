# 🌿 RishiVeda Assist

**RishiVeda Assist** is a UX research and design project focused on improving communication and workflow efficiency in Ayurvedic Panchakarma management.

This initiative was inspired by real-world challenges faced by Ayurvedic doctors and therapists in managing treatment scheduling, documentation, and communication.  
The goal is to create digital solutions that simplify these processes while preserving the essence of Ayurvedic practice.
